<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/tl-2023-2001">Wh-questions in dynamic inquisitive semantics</a></h2>
<h5>Floris Roelofsen &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Theoretical linguistics, target article</h5>
<p>This target article presents a type-theoretic dynamic inquisitive semantics framework, extending
the first-order system presented in Dotlačil &amp; Roelofsen (2019). Within this framework, we
develop a compositional treatment of wh-questions whose basic premise is that a wh-phrase
introduces a discourse referent u, just like non-interrogative indefinites do, and requires the
presence of an operator in the left periphery of the clause which requests a witness for u, i.e., it raises an issue whose resolution requires identifying at least one individual that has all the properties ascribed to u. In previous work, it has been argued that a dynamic semantic analysis of questions is needed to account for anaphora with wh-antecedents and for certain kinds of intervention effects (Haida, 2007). Here, we further develop the general approach and argue that it has several additional benefits. Namely, it allows for a uniform treatment of single-wh and multiple-wh questions, it derives mention-some and mention-all readings in a principled way, as well as an often neglected partial mention-some reading in multiple-wh questions, it can capture certain constraints on the availability of mention-some readings, and the effects of number marking on which-phrases across single-wh and multiple-wh questions.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.jakubdotlacil.com/publications/papers/chromy_lacina_dotlacil.pdf">Number Agreement Attraction in Czech Comprehension: Negligible Facilitation Effects</a></h2>
<h5>Jan Chromý, Radim Lacina &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Open Mind</h5>
<p>Number agreement attraction in comprehension has been extensively studied in various
languages and it has been claimed that attraction effects are generally present across
languages. In this paper, four experiments on Czech are presented, each examining a
different structure. The Bayesian hierarchical models and Bayes factor analysis pointed
towards no agreement attraction effects in three of the experiments. Only in one
experiment an effect interpretable as signaling agreement attraction was observed. Its size,
however, was so small that it did not translate into a clear preference for models with
agreement attraction. The data from the four experiments were further compared to
available data from several other languages (English, Armenian, Arabic, and Spanish). The
emerging picture is that in Czech, agreement attraction effects are negligible in size if they
appear at all. This presents a serious challenge to current theoretical explanations of
agreement attraction effects.</p>

<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10988-021-09336-9">Ignorance implicatures of modified numerals</a></h2>
<h5>Alexandre Cremers, Liz Coppock, Jakub Dotlačil &amp; Floris Roelofsen</h5>
<h5>Linguistics and Philosphy</h5>
<p>Modified numerals, such as at least three and more than five, are known to sometimes give rise to ignorance inferences. However, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the nature of these inferences, their context dependence, and differences between at least and more than. We present a series of experiments which sheds new light on these issues. Our results show that (a) the ignorance inferences of at least are more robust than those of more than, (b) the presence and strength of the ignorance inferences triggered by both at least and more than depends on the question under discussion (QUD), and (c) whether ignorance inferences are detected in a given experimental setting depends partly on the task that participants are asked to perform (e.g., an acceptability task versus an inference task). We offer an Optimality Theoretic account of these findings. In particular, the task effect is captured by assuming that in performing an acceptability task, participants take the speaker’s perspective in order to determine whether an expression is optimal given a certain epistemic state, while in performing an inference task they take the addressee’s perspective in order to determine what the most likely epistemic state of the speaker is given a certain expression. To execute the latter task in a fully rational manner, participants have to perform higher-order reasoning about alternative expressions the speaker could have used. Under the assumption that participants do not always perform such higher-order reasoning but also often resort to so-called unidirectional optimization, the task effect finds a natural explanation. This also allows us to relate our finding to asymmetries between comprehension and production that have been found in language acquisition.</p>

<p>(Self- Paced Reading: A Critical Introduction to the Method)</p>
<p>Self-paced reading has been a widely used experimental method for study of the processing of sentences and texts. In this paper, we introduce the method to the Czech audience. We summarize its advantages and limitations and provide practical suggestions on stimuli construction and data processing. We also present different variants of the method, we discuss its ecological validity, and we summarize the experimental evidence showing that reaction times collected in self-paced reading can be linked to processing demands people might experience during reading. Finally, we present three examples of the application of the method: an experiment on agreement attraction in Czech, an experiment on garden-path sentences in Czech and an experiment studying the processing of short discourses in English. We also briefly discuss new trends that connect corpus linguistics with psycholinguistic discourse processing research and lead to the development of reading-time corpora.</p>

<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.13020">Parsing as a cue-based retrieval model</a></h2>
<h5>Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Cognitive Science</h5>
<p>This paper develops a novel psycholinguistic parser and tests it against experimental and corpus reading data. The parser builds on the recent research into memory structures, which argues that memory retrieval is content-addressable and cue-based. It is shown that the theory of cue-based memory systems can be combined with transition-based parsing to produce a parser that, when combined with the cognitive architecture ACT-R, can model reading and predict online behavioral measures (reading times and regressions). The parser's modeling capacities are tested against self-paced reading experimental data (Grodner &amp; Gibson, 2005), eye-tracking experimental data (Staub, 2011), and a self-paced reading corpus (Futrell et al., 2018).</p>
<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198795858.013.2">Semantic approaches to number</a></h2>
<h5>Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>The Oxford Handbook of Grammatical Number</h5>
<p>This chapter presents semantic frameworks that model the general capability of language to refer to atomic, as well as non-atomic entities. Two approaches are developed and discussed in detail throughout the chapter: a set-theoretic approach and an approach in which entities are modelled as atomic and plural individuals. After the formal introduction of the two approaches, the chapter shows how number marking in language can be represented and how other concepts related to semantic number, in particular, distributivity, cumulativity and collectivity, have been analysed in formal semantic theories.</p>
<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.657705">Parsing model and a rational theory of memory</a></h2>
<h5>Jakub Dotlačil &amp; Puck de Haan</h5>
<h5>Frontiers in Psychology</h5>
<p>This paper explores how the rational theory of memory summarized in Anderson (1991) can inform the computational psycholinguistic models of human parsing. It is shown that transition-based parsing is particularly suitable to be combined with Anderson's theory of memory systems. The combination of the rational theory of memory with the transition-based parsers results in a model of sentence processing that is data-driven and can be embedded in the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R). The predictions of the parser are tested against qualitative data (garden-path sentences) and a self-paced reading corpus (the Natural Stories corpus).</p>
<h2><a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12546">Reinforcement learning for production-based cognitive models</a></h2>
<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Topics in Cognitive Science</h5>
<p>Production-based cognitive models, such as ACT-R or Soar agents, have been a popular tool in cognitive science to model sequential decision processes. While the models have been useful in articulating assumptions and predictions of various theories, they unfortunately require a significant amount of hand coding, both with respect to what building blocks cognitive processes should consist of and with respect to how these building blocks are selected and ordered in a sequential decision process. Hand coding large, realistic models poses a challenge for modelers, and also makes it unclear whether the models can be learned and are thus cognitively plausible. The learnability issue is probably most starkly present in cognitive models of linguistic skills, since linguistic skills involve richly structured representations and highly complex rules. We investigate how Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods can be used to solve the production selection and production ordering problem in ACT-R. We focus on four algorithms from the Q learning family, tabular Q and three versions of Deep Q Networks (DQNs), as well as the ACT-R utility learning algorithm, which provides a baseline for the Q algorithms. We compare the performance of these five algorithms in a range of lexical decision (LD) tasks framed as sequential decision problems. We observe that, unlike the ACT-R baseline, the Q agents learn even the more complex LD tasks fairly well. However, tabular Q and DQNs show a trade-off between speed of learning, applicability to more complex tasks and how noisy the learned rules are. This indicates that the ACT-R subsymbolic system for procedural memory could be improved by incorporating more insights from RL approaches, particularly the function-approximation based ones, which learn and generalize effectively in complex, more realistic tasks.</p>
<h2><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.1131">The representation and processing of distributivity and collectivity: ambiguity vs. underspecification</a></h2>
<h5>Jakub Dotlačil &amp; Adrian Brasoveanu</h5>
<h5>Glossa: a journal of general linguistics</h5>
<p>Sentences with plural expressions can receive at least two interpretations. For example, the sentence The boys hold a balloon could mean that the boys as a group jointly hold one balloon (the collective reading) or that each boy holds one balloon, which would imply that as many balloons were held as there are boys (the distributive reading). Building on Frazier et al. (1999), we show that the human processor favors collective readings. Crucially, the preference for collective readings is only observed when the distributive reading has to be established through the means of phrasal distributivity (e.g., triggered by distributive quantifiers), and the preference disappears in case of lexical distributivity (e.g., the distributive interpretation of win). The findings provide evidence for different mental representations of the two types of distributivity and shed light on why the processor exhibits a default preference for collective interpretations.</p>

<h5>Jakub Dotlačil &amp; Floris Roelofsen</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory 30</h5>
<p>We develop a uniform analysis of single-wh and multiple-wh questions couched in dynamic inquisitive semantics. The analysis captures the effects of number marking on which-phrases, and derives both mention-some and mention-all readings as well as an often neglected partial mention-some reading in multiple-wh questions. </p>

<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118788516.sem017">Donkey anaphora</a></h2>
<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>The Wiley Blackwell Companion to Semantics</h5>
<p>This chapter reviews a set of empirical problems faced by formal semantics frameworks that rely on classical static logic in the analysis of pronoun interpretation. The phenomena discussed challenge the idea that the natural language notions of quantifier scope, binding, coreference, covariation, and their compositional interaction match the corresponding notions and their compositional interaction in classical logic. Traditionally, the solutions to these empirical problems are taken to fall into two classes: dynamic accounts and E-type approaches. The chapter discusses these two classes of solutions, and concludes by noting that the most recent approaches to donkey anaphora and related phenomena cannot be neatly classified as belonging to only one side of this divide.</p>
<h2><a href="https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.cmcl-1.3">Production-based cognitive models as a test suite for reinforcement learning algorithms</a></h2>
<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, ACL</h5>
<p>We introduce a framework in which production-rule based computational cognitive modeling and Reinforcement Learning can systematically interact and inform each other. We focus on linguistic applications because the sophisticated rule-based cognitive models needed to capture linguistic behavioral data promise to provide a stringent test suite for RL algorithms, connecting RL algorithms to both accuracy and reaction-time experimental data. Thus, we open a path towards assembling an experimentally rigorous and cognitively realistic benchmark for RL algorithms. We extend our previous work on lexical decision tasks and tabular RL algorithms with a discussion of neural-network based approaches, and a discussion of how parsing can be formalized as an RL problem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.jakubdotlacil.com/publications/papers/RL_for_ACTR_20.pdf">Reinforcement learning for production-based cognitive models</a></h2>
<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of ICCM 2020</h5>
<p>We introduce a framework in which we can start exploring in a computationally explicit way how complex, mechanistically specified, and production-based cognitive models of linguistic skills, e.g., ACT-R based parsers, can be acquired. Cognitive models for linguistic skills pose this learnability problem much more starkly than models for other `high-level' cognitive processes, as they call for richly structured representations and complex rules that require a significant amount of hand-coding. In this paper, we focus on how Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods can be used as a way to solve the production selection problem in ACT-R. Production rules are treated as the actions of an RL agent, and the ACT-R model/mind as the environment in the RL sense. We focus on a basic learning algorithm (tabular Q-learning) and a very simple task, namely lexical decision (LD), framed as a sequential decision problem, with the goal of learning when a specific rule should be fired. Learning is faster and less noisy for shorter LD tasks (fewer stimuli), but the Q-learning agent manages to learn longer tasks fairly well. Realistically long LD tasks and more complex models, e.g., parsers, are left for future research.</p>

<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Springer, Language, Cognition and Mind (LCAM) Series</h5>
<p><img alt="bookcover" src="https://www.jakubdotlacil.com/images/comp-cog-modeling-cover.jpg"></p>
<p>This open access book introduces a general framework that allows natural language researchers to enhance existing competence theories with fully specified performance and processing components. Gradually developing increasingly complex and cognitively realistic competence-performance models, it provides running code for these models and shows how to fit them to real-time experimental data. This computational cognitive modeling approach opens up exciting new directions for research in formal semantics, and linguistics more generally, and offers new ways of (re)connecting semantics and the broader field of cognitive science.</p>
<p>The approach of this book is novel in more ways than one. Assuming the mental architecture and procedural modalities of Anderson’s ACT-R framework, it presents fine-grained computational models of human language processing tasks which make detailed quantitative predictions that can be checked against the results of self-paced reading and other psycho-linguistic experiments. All models are presented as computer programs that readers can run on their own computer and on inputs of their choice, thereby learning to design, program and run their own models. But even for readers who won't do all that, the book will show how such detailed, quantitatively predicting modeling of linguistic processes is possible. A methodological breakthrough and a must for anyone concerned about the future of linguistics! (Hans Kamp) </p>
<p>This book constitutes a major step forward in linguistics and psycholinguistics. It constitutes a unique synthesis of several different research traditions: computational models of psycholinguistic processes, and formal models of semantics and discourse processing. The work also introduces a sophisticated python-based software environment for modeling linguistic processes. This book has the potential to revolutionize not only formal models of linguistics, but also models of language processing more generally. (Shravan Vasishth)</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>The book integrates formal semantic theories, specifically, DRT, and mechanistic processing models formulated in the ACT-R cognitive architecture into a new computational framework that can simulate human participants in real-time psycholinguistic tasks, fit these cognitive models to experimental data by embedding them into Bayesian models, and quantitatively compare qualitative (symbolic) theories.</p>
<p>In more detail, we introduce an extensible framework for mechanistic processing models that integrate formal syntax and semantics theories, an independently motivated cognitive architecture (ACT-R; Anderson and Lebiere 1998, Anderson 2007) and Bayesian methods of data analysis, parameter estimation and model comparison. The book culminates with the development of computationally-explicit processing models for natural language semantic phenomena that integrate Discourse Representation Theory (DRT; Kamp 1981, Kamp &amp; Reyle 1993), ACT-R and Bayesian models.</p>
<p>These mechanistic processing models implement end-to-end simulations of human participants in real-time psycholinguistic experiments. End-to-end means that we model visual and motor processes together with specifically linguistic representations and processes in complete models of the experimental tasks. The models embed theoretical hypotheses about linguistic representations and about parsing processes in ACT-R. The resulting ACT-R cognitive models are then embedded in Bayesian models to fit them to experimental data, estimate their parameters and perform quantitative model comparison for qualitative (symbolic) theories.</p>
<p>A novel Python3 reimplementation of ACT-R called <em>pyactr</em> (<a href="https://github.com/jakdot/pyactr">current version</a>; <a href="https://github.com/abrsvn/pyactr-book">book version, including all book code</a>) provides the crucial software infrastructure for developing ACT-R models that can be easily embedded in Bayesian models.</p>

<p>Quantification is abundant in natural language and is one of the most studied topics in generative grammar. Sentences with multiple quantifiers are famously ambiguous with respect to their quantifier scope, representing a type of ambiguity related to, but not necessary the same as, structural ambiguity. Two key questions in the psycholinguistic study of quantification are: (i) how does the human processor assign quantifier scope?; and (ii) how and under what circumstances is this scope assignment reanalyzed? The investigation of these questions lies at the intersection of psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics. We summarize both strands of research, and discuss experimental data that played an essential role in the (psycho)linguistic theorizing about the topic of processing quantification and quantifier scope.</p>

<h5>Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Topics in Cognitive Science</h5>
<p>Cognitive architectures have often been applied to data from individual experiments. In this paper, I develop an ACT-R reader that can model a much larger set of data, eye-tracking corpus data. It is shown that the resulting model has a good fit to the data for the considered low-level processes. Unlike previous related works (most prominently, Engelmann, Vasishth, Engbert and Kliegl, 2013 ), the model achieves the fit by estimating free parameters of ACT-R using Bayesian estimation and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, rather than by relying on the mix of manual selection + default values. The method used in the paper is generalizable beyond this particular model and data set and could be used on other ACT-R models.</p>

<p>We introduce a Python3 reimplementation of ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere 1998, Anderson 2007) in which we build an end-to-end simulation of syntactic parsing in a typical self-paced reading experiment. The model uses an eager left-corner parsing strategy implemented as a skill in procedural memory (following Lewis and Vasishth 2005), makes use of independently motivated components of the ACT-R framework (procedural memory, content-addressable declarative memory – cf. Wagers et al. 2009), and explicitly models the motor and visual processes involved in self-paced reading. The ACT- R model can be embedded in a Bayesian statistical model to estimate its subsymbolic parameters and perform model comparison.</p>

<p>In this paper we address the question whether it makes sense to assume that the domain of degrees, as used in degree semantics, consists not just of atoms, but also of degree pluralities. A number of recent works have adopted that assumption, most explicitly Fitzgibbons et al (2008); Beck (2014); Dotlačil and Nouwen (2016). In this paper, we provide experimental evidence for degree pluralities by showing that comparatives may express cumulative relations between degrees.</p>

<p>We introduce a new framework in which (i) qualitative generative grammar hypotheses can be embedded into performance/processing models, and (ii) these integrated competence-performance models are embedded into Bayesian models, which enables us to fit them to experimental data and do quantitative model comparison for qualitative theories. Building on Lewis and Vasishth (2005), step (i) takes generative theories and embeds them in processing theories formulated in the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson and Lebiere 1998). In a new Python3 computational implementation of ACT-R, we do step (ii), namely use ACT-R models as the likelihood component of full Bayesian models.

<h5>Semantics and Pragmatics 10</h5>
<p>We identify a new scope puzzle for quantifiers in comparative clauses. In particular, we argue that nominal quantifiers take scope at a higher level in the degree clause than previously assumed. On the assumption that quantifier scope is clause-bounded, this entails that there must be more structure in the clause than standardly assumed.</p>

<h5>Proceedings of the 41st Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development</h5>
<p>How children learn to interpret sentences with plural expressions is still not fully understood.</p>
<p>Adults prefer collective readings with “the”-DPs, e.g. The boys pushed a car means one car. Replace “the” with “each” and adults only get distributive readings.  Children allow both initially, gradually rejecting collective readings with “each”-DPs.  Study 1 found that  correctly rejecting collective readings with  “each” DPs correlated with rejecting distributive readings with “the” DPs. </p>
<p>Study 2 investigated children's understanding of the adjective of comparison (AOC) “different” related to distributivity. If The boys pushed a different car , are there multiple cars (a sentence internal reading, similar to distributive readings), or did they push a different car than e.g. the girls (a discourse reading, similar to collective readings.)?  Study 2 found children were more adult-like. However, rejecting the distributive interpretation with “the” in Study 1 did not correlate with rejection of  internal readings with “different” in Study 2, contrary our predictions.</p>

<h5><a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/11050">Natural Language Semantics</a>, 24(1), 45-78</h5>
<p>Quantifiers in phrasal and clausal comparatives often seem to take distributive scope in the matrix clause: for instance, the sentence John is taller than every girl is is true iff for every girl it holds that John is taller than that girl. Broadly speaking, two approaches were developed that derive this reading without postulating the (problematic) wide scope of the quantifier: the negation analysis and the interval analysis of than clauses. We propose a modification of the interval analysis, in which than clauses are not treated as degree intervals, but degree pluralities. This small change has significant consequences: it yields a successful account of differentials in comparatives and it correctly predicts the existence of hitherto unnoticed readings, viz. cumulative readings of clausal comparatives. Finally, this paper also makes the case that using degree pluralities is conceptually appealing: it allows us to restrict the analysis of comparatives by mechanisms that are postulated independently in the semantics of pluralities.</p>

<h5><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/pqje20/current">The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</a>, 69(3), 455-481</h5>
<p>In three eye-tracking experiments the influence of the Dutch causal connective `want' (because) and the working memory capacity of readers on the usage of verb-based implicit causality was examined. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that although a causal connective is not required to activate implicit causality information during reading, effects of implicit causality surfaced more rapidly and more pronounced when a connective was present in the discourse than when it was absent. In addition, Experiment 3 revealed that - in contrast to previous claims (Long and De Ley, 2000) - the activation of implicit causality is not a resource-consuming mental operation. Moreover, readers with higher and lower working memory capacities behaved differently in a dual task situation. Higher span readers were more likely to use implicit causality when they had all their working memory resources at their disposal. Lower span readers showed the opposite pattern as they were more likely to use the implicit causality cue in case of an additional working memory load. The results emphasize that both linguistic and cognitive factors mediate the impact of implicit causality on text comprehension. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the ongoing controversies in the literature, i.e., the focusing-integration debate and the debates on the source of implicit causality.</p>

<h5>Stavroula Alexandropoulou, Jakub Dotlačil &amp; Rick Nouwen</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory 26</h5>
<p>We present results of an eye-tracking reading study that directly probes ignorance effects of the superlative numeral modifier at least in embedding and unembedding environments. We find that interpreting a numeral (phrase) modified by at least in a context with an ignorant speaker is costlier than in a context with a knowledgeable speaker, regardless of whether at least is in an embedding environment or not. In line with online studies testing scalar implicatures using a similar paradigm, this finding is taken to suggest that the observed processing cost is due to the derivation of ignorance interpretations via a pragmatic mechanism. Our results, given the paradigm we employ, further enable us to adjudicate not only between semantic and pragmatic accounts of ignorance, but also among various pragmatic proposals, favouring neo-Gricean accounts that derive ignorance as a quantity implicature (Büring 2008; Cummins &amp; Katsos 2010; Schwarz 2013; Kennedy 2015). We find no evidence indicating that ignorance with at least in interaction with a universal modal involves an extra operation, like covert movement.</p>

<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory 25</h5>
<p>The main question we investigate is whether meaning representations of the kind that are pervasive in formal semantics are built up incrementally and predictively when language is used in real time, in much the same way that the real-time construction of syntactic representations has been argued to be. The interaction of presupposition resolution with conjunctions vs. conditionals with a sentence-final antecedent promises to provide us with the right kind of evidence. Consider the following `cataphoric' example and the contrast between AND and IF : Tina will have coffee with Alex again AND / IF she had coffee with him at the local cafe. We expect the second clause to be more difficult after AND than after IF : the conjunction AND signals that an antecedent that could resolve the again presupposition is unlikely to come after this point (the second conjunct is interpreted relative to the context provided by the first conjunct), while the conditional IF leaves open the possibility that a suitable resolution for the again presupposition is forthcoming (the first clause is interpreted relative to the context provided by the second clause). We present experimental evidence supporting these predictions and discuss two approaches to analyze this kind of data.</p>

We also found that the precise nature of the inferences in question is one that favours a theory positing a rather modest set of alternatives for modified numerals.</p>

<h5>Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Slavic Languages in the Perspective of Formal Grammar : Proceedings of FDSL 10.5</h5>
<p>Sentences with pluralities can be interpreted in several ways. One such interpretation involves collective action, in which the plurality, as a whole, functions as an argument. In another, distributive, interpretation, each member of the plurality fulfills the same argument role. It has been noted that the distributive interpretation is often marked. This paper discusses an experiment on Czech providing evidence that distributivity is marked because (i) readers prefer simpler syntactic structures (Minimal Attachment, Frazier, 1978), and (ii) distributivity is syntactically more complex than the collective interpretation and the difference is marked on dependent arguments, most commonly, objects.</p>

<p>We present the results of two experiments, an eye-tracking study and a follow-up self-paced reading study, investigating the interpretation of quantifier scope in sentences with three quantifiers: two indefinites in subject and object positions and a universal distributive quantifier in adjunct position. In addition to the fact that such three-way scope interactions have not been experimentally investigated before, they enable us to distinguish between different theories of quantifier scope interpretation in ways that are not possible when only simpler, two-way interactions are considered. The experiments show that contrary to underspecification theories of scope, a totally ordered scope-hierarchy representation is maintained and modified across sentences and this scope representation cannot be reduced to the truth-conditional/mental model representation of sentential meaning. The experiments also show that the processor uses scope-disambiguating information as early as possible to (re)analyze scope representation.</p>

<h5>Adrian Brasoveanu &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp">Semantics and Pragmatics</a>, 8, 1-52</h5>
<p>This paper investigates the processing of sentence-internal same with four licensors (all, each, every and the) in two orders: licensor+same (surface scope) and same+licensor (inverse scope). Our two self-paced reading studies show that there is no general effect of surface vs. inverse scope, which we take as an argument for a model-oriented view of the processing cost of inverse scope: the inverse scope of quantifiers seems to be costly because of model structure reanalysis, not because of covert scope operations. The second result is methodological: the psycholinguistic investigation of semantic phenomena like quantifiers and the licensing of sentence-internal readings should always involve a context that prompts a deep enough processing of the target expressions. In one of our two studies, participants read the target sentences after reading a scenario introducing the two sets of entities the quantifier NP and the same NP referred to and they were asked to determine whether the sentence was true or false relative to the background scenario every time. In the other study, the participants read the same sentences without any context and there were fewer follow-up comprehension questions. The relevant effects observed in the study with contexts completely disappeared in the out-of-context study, although the participants in both studies were monitored for their level of attention to the experimental task.</p>

<h5>Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5><a href="http://jos.oxfordjournals.org">Journal of Semantics</a>, 30(4), 423-477</h5>
<p>Reciprocal sentences require distributivity for the correct interpretation. In the semantic literature on reciprocals, it is standard to assume that distributivity spans almost everything in reciprocal clauses, including not only reciprocals but also predicates and their arguments. In contrast to this tradition, I argue that nothing but reciprocals themselves should be interpreted distributively. Such a semantics of reciprocal clauses can be accommodated in dynamic frameworks which can store and retrieve dependencies between pluralities, modeled as plural information states, i.e., sets of variable assignments (van den Berg 1996, Nouwen 2003, Brasoveanu 2007, among others). I argue that a reciprocal distributes over nothing else but a plural information state, and I provide compositional interpretation of reciprocity using Plural Compositional Discourse Representation Theory (the extension of Compositional Discourse Representation Theory of Muskens 1996 by Brasoveanu 2007, 2008).</p>

<p>Adjectives of comparison (AOCs) like <i>same</i>, <i>different</i> and <i>similar</i> can compare two elements sentence-internally, i.e., without referring to any previously introduced element. This reading is licensed only if a semantically plural NP is present. We argue in this paper that it is incorrect to describe a particular NP as either licensing or not licensing the sentence-internal reading of a specific AOC: licensing is more fine-grained. We use experimental methods to establish which NPs license which AOCs and to what extent and we show how the results can be interpreted against the background of a formal semantic analysis of AOCs. Finally, we argue that using Bayesian methods to analyze this kind of data has an advantage over the more traditional, frequentist approach.</p>

Compositional accounts, as Zimmermann (2002) and Blaheta (2003) can deal with basic cases but run into troubles when <i>each</i> appears in adjuncts or is embedded in another noun phrase. I offer a novel analysis of distance distributivity in which <i>each</i> is treated as an anaphoric determiner. This analysis is compositional but it avoids pitfalls of previous accounts. Finally, I show how the analysis can be formalized using Plural Compositional DRT.</p>

<h5>Elena Pagliarini, Gaetano Fiorin &amp; Jakub Dotlačil</h5>
<h5>Proceedings of the 36th Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development</h5>
<p>Definite plural noun phrases (NPs) can be interpreted either collectively or distributively. For example, the sentence <i>the boys lifted two boxes</i> can mean that the boys acted as a group in lifting two boxes (collective reading) or that each boy lifted two boxes (distributive reading). However, it has been observed that adults fully accept collective readings of definite plural NPs, but find distributive readings marginal. We present the results of an experiment testing the hypothesis that the degraded status of the distributive reading of plural definite NPs is a case of conversational implicature: a definite plural NP such as <i>the boys</i> is not interpreted distributively because, if the speaker wanted to express a distributive interpretation, she would have used the NP <i>each boy</i> which unambiguously expresses a distributive reading. The following predictions were tested: (i) in language development, the rejection of distributive readings with non-quantificational noun phrases follows the acquisition of <i>each</i>; (ii) the level of acquisition of <i>each</i> predicts whether subjects will reject distributive readings or not. The results of the experiment show that children learn to reject the collective reading of <i>each</i> before they learn to reject the distributive reading of plural definite NPs. The results also show that children's acceptance of the collective reading of <i>each</i> is a significant predictor of children's acceptance of the distributive reading of plural definite NPs. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis.</p>

We present an analysis which (i) builds on the semantics of attitude verbs of Cresswell and von Stechow (1982) and (ii) event semantics of Landman (2000).

<p>This thesis investigates two issues. It studies the interpretations of sentences with plural arguments and it analyzes anaphoricity triggered by the presence of semantically plural nouns. Regarding the first point, it is standardly assumed that sentences with plural arguments can have many interpretations. This thesis discusses various psycholinguistic experiments, as well as two new questionnaire studies, which show in detail how the preferences among these interpretations depend on the type of noun phrase, including preferences that are commonly not acknowledged in the semantic literature. One goal of this thesis is to offer a semantic and pragmatic account which captures all the interpretations but can also explain why some are preferred over others. The explanation is used for studying the anaphoric expressions 'same', 'different', 'others' and reciprocals. What these expressions share is their ability to be anaphoric sentence-internally if there is a semantically plural noun in the clause. However, the availability of this reading depends on the type of noun phrase used, in a similar way that preferences in the interpretations do. Based on these and other data, the thesis offers a novel formal semantic analysis of reciprocals and argues for a particular semantics of 'same', 'different' and 'others'. It is shown what consequences the analysis has for our understanding of anaphoricity and plurality.</p>
<p>This study is relevant for scholars working on binding, anaphora, and the semantics and pragmatics of pluralities. More generally, it is of interest to scholars in the field of semantics and pragmatics, as well as for linguists working on the syntax-semantics interface.</p>

<p>Two markedly distinct analyses have been developed for reciprocal expression like <i>each other</i>. One very popular approach treats them as anaphoric noun phrases, i.e., noun phrases containing free variables that come with various constraints on their binding configurations (Heim et al., 1991a,b, Schwarzschild 1996, Sternefeld 1998, Beck 2001). The other approach treats them as polyadic quantifiers (Keenan 1992, Dalrymple et al. 1998, Sabato and Winter 2005: a.o.). We argue that both approaches are in fact neccessary but for different expressions. More in particular, we argue that the latter approach is correct for <i>each other</i>, while the former one leads to an elegant account for the properties of <i>the others</i>.</p>

I argue that Czech and Russian exhibit non-local binding of a different origin. Non-local binding in these languages arises because of variation in the architecture of infinitival clauses. More concretely, it is argued that infinitival clauses may lack PRO, and the absence of PRO makes non-local binding possible.
